# PercolationSimulation
Simulation code along with the data analysis notebooks for the simulation of the percolation process.

Percolation is a process of fluid movement and dispersion. In this project it is simulated on the two dimensional grid and the results are analysed in the plots. Burning method and Hoshen-Kopelman algorithms were implemented for this goal. After the percolation was simulated with different initial parameters its structural properties such as clusters and shortest path distribution are measured.
